# VisionMetrix - Future Enhancements

The long-term vision for VisionMetrix is to evolve into a full measurement + analytics + industrial management system. The following phases outline the planned roadmap for future development:

## Phase 2: SaaS Platform (Authentication + Database)
- User registration and JWT authentication
- MongoDB database for measurement history
- Multi-project/store management
- Measurement export (CSV, JSON)
- Analytics dashboard with trends and charts

## Phase 3: Advanced Computer Vision
- Camera calibration for lens distortion correction
- Monocular depth estimation (MiDaS model)
- Stereo vision support
- Reduced dependency on A4 reference

## Phase 4: 3D Measurement
- Plane estimation and 3D coordinate reconstruction
- 3D bounding box detection
- Volume measurement
- Point cloud generation

## Phase 5: AI Refinement
- Machine learning correction models
- Systematic error compensation
- Feature-based accuracy prediction
- Regression models for measurement refinement
